Think normalize.css without the comments and dropping all the IE stuff.

In all honesty it is better to use the far superior normalize.css - https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/ than ths version which is just where I cut out all the comments (which some would find helpful) and removed all the IE parts because IE is dead.
