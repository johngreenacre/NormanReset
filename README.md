Think normalize.css without the comments and dropping all the IE stuff.

In all honesty it is better to use the far superior normalize.css - https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/ than ths version which is just where I cut out all the comments (which some would find helpful) and removed all the IE parts because IE is dead.

To be fair, I should have forked the origianl normalize.css, but I used it for myself, and was originally use it as a private repository. But, just in case anyone else wanted to use it, I made it public.
